<h2>whoami</h2>
<p>
  Hi, I’m Afiq Fahmi, also known as nyamuk or 4kaza hahah. I’m a graduate from Universiti Kuala Lumpur Malaysian Institute of Information Technology. I’m really interested in DFIR, and honestly it started when I took a DFIR subject at uni. From there I was like, okay… this is interesting. It feels like being Sherlock for real, you get to recover deleted files, do triage on artifacts, and piece together what happened. It’s basically solving puzzles from a “case”, like a detective, and that’s exactly why I like it. I’m still in the slow learning phase, but I’m not rushing. I’m just trying to improve little by little and get stronger with the fundamentals. I also did my internship at UEM Group Berhad, and that gave me a good look at how work feels in an actual environment, not just theory. During my free time, I usually do CTFs if not busy, play games ps: of course who know me they know what I games I played, and sometimes go fishing if there’s a plan with my friends. I also try to take free certifications whenever I can because I don’t really have money for the expensive ones yet, huhu sad, but I’m still collecting what I can and building skills from practice.
